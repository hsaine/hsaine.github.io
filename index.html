						<h3>ON Site Research Internship </h3>
						<p>During my internship at the Laboratory of Systems Engineering in Versailles (LISV), which took place from June 17th to July 26st, I engaged in a research project titled "Development of a Human Movement Prediction Model for Exoskeleton Control." Over the course of these five weeks, I had the opportunity to delve into various aspects within the laboratory.

During the initial week, our focus was on comprehending articles related to EMG signals, feature extraction, and the stages of EMG signal filtering. In the subsequent week, I interpreted existing data containing recorded EMG signals from triceps and biceps muscles. This interpretation allowed us to gain insights into the signals' characteristics.

Moving on to the second week, I worked with a dataset involving "hand-to-nose movements" from 20 patients. This dataset consisted of 10 muscle EMG signals per patient. My analysis included a detailed examination of each muscle and the corresponding EMG signals. This comparison was conducted across the 20 patients.

In the third week, I had the privilege of gathering data from 10 enthusiastic volunteers who performed flexion-extension motions for both triceps and biceps muscles. The volunteers executed these motions with and without a 2 kg load, in addition to performing maximum voluntary contractions (MVC) for both muscle groups. This data collection resulted in approximately 90 sets of data.

During the final weeks of the internship, my focus shifted towards data analysis. I carefully selected complete and noise-free data recordings, discarding incomplete or unreliable entries. For each volunteer, I applied filtering techniques to the signals, followed by multiple feature extraction methods. The results of this analysis enabled the calculation of the elbow angle. This calculated angle was then compared with the angle obtained through other measurement methods to assess correlation.

Throughout this internship, I acquired knowledge about interfacing with EMG signals, ,the Vicon Camera system, and the placement of markers and how to use the 3D vicon softawre.

						<h3>Remote Application Internship </h3>
						<p>The purpose of this internship is to develop a mobile application that solves the problem of prescription validation. The main issue is that certain drugs require validation by pharmacists before nurses can administer them to patients. This problem arises due to the large number of patients. To address this issue, we have decided to develop an application that facilitates the validation process.
                                                  By the end of this internship, our goal is to develop a prototype application and create a functional database that links doctors, nurses, and pharmacists. We will be using Wamp Server, MySQL, PHPMyAdmin, PHP, and Postman for this purpose. Additionally, we will rely on diagrams to assist in the development process.
                                                 Skills required for this internship include critical thinking, database administration, database design, proficiency in Figma (software), and the ability to work effectively in a team.</p>

	<h3>Safety deposit box using LabVIEW MyRIO.</h3>
	<span class="date"><span class="icon-calendar"></span> May 2023 - Jun 2023</span>
	<p>The objective of this project is to develop a safety deposit box using LabVIEW MyRIO, which enables users to store valuable items and secure
	them with a four-digit PIN code. The major challenge of this project involves designing a finite state machine to manage the different states of
	the safety deposit box, including "open," "locking in progress," "locked," and "opening in progress." To facilitate user interaction, the system
	features a keyboard and LCD display for entering the PIN code and displaying instructions and alerts in case of suspicious activities.
        Additionally, the safety deposit box controller incorporates a servo for locking and unlocking the box and a mode for resetting the code for
	a new client or in case the user forgets the code.
The system is programmed using LabVIEW to monitor and control all components and ensure that the finite state machine detects only unique key presses. 
		Furthermore, an LED indicator can be used to signify the locking status of the safety deposit box.</p>

	<h3>ROVERBOT</h3>
	<span class="date"><span class="icon-calendar"></span>Nov 2022 - Jan 2023 </span>
	<p>
Roverbot is a mechanum wheels robotic vehicle that is designed to move in all directions, thanks to its advanced algorithms that plan the most efficient routes to reach its destination. Its unique feature is its ability to move in tight spaces with precision, thanks to its mechanum wheels. Additionally, it is equipped with a navigation system to locate its position and follow a predetermined route, as well as an obstacle detection system to avoid collisions.

Our goal is to create a robot that can move effectively through a maze using advanced autonomous navigation techniques, while being able to detect and avoid obstacles. We hope that Roverbot will be able to perform useful tasks such as surveillance, mapping, search and rescue, and delivery.

Our algorithm for this mobile robot project consists of using a matrix to represent the maze, where each cell is numbered based on its distance to the destination. The destination itself is marked with a "0", the adjacent cells are marked with a "1", the cells next to the cells marked with "1" are marked with "2" and so on, until all the cells are filled. Then, the robot is placed in a random cell and uses this matrix to plan the shortest path to reach the destination while avoiding obstacles, which are defined as cells with high values in the matrix.

		The objective of this project is to create a fuzzy controller for a differential drive robot.
		The aim is to familiarize ourselves with fuzzy logic and to explore the capabilities of Simulink.
		The project involves modeling the kinematics of the robot in a block and linking it to a block of fuzzy logic.
		The robot has two speeds, which are both the outputs of our fuzzy controller and the inputs for the robot model. Our system is looped : 
		we initially provide the positions that the robot should reach, these positions enter a subtract block along with the estimated model measurements to provide errors that are used as inputs for the fuzzy controller. According to the rules and inference used, the controller provides the necessary speeds for the robot to navigate towards the destination. 
		The robot will reach its destination when the errors cancel each other out.

	We participated in the first 'Road Assistant Robot' challenge. The objective of this challenge was to assemble the robot from scratch and program it to overcome obstacles and reach the end of the maze. Here is an overview of the activity:

Initially, the robots were placed in their stations. Upon receiving an RFID signal (each RFID signal was assigned to a specific destination), the robot had to react and identify the type of fire present and decide which type of fire to respond to, in order to reach its destination. The robot had to navigate through static and dynamic obstacles, as well as a maze, to reach its destination.

The challenge consisted of three elimination phases, and fortunately, my team qualified for the second phase, securing the fifth position. Alhamdulillah
