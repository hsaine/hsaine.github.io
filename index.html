	<h3>Safety deposit box using LabVIEW MyRIO.</h3>
	<span class="date"><span class="icon-calendar"></span> May 2023 - Jun 2023</span>
	<p>The objective of this project is to develop a safety deposit box using LabVIEW MyRIO, which enables users to store valuable items and secure
	them with a four-digit PIN code. The major challenge of this project involves designing a finite state machine to manage the different states of
	the safety deposit box, including "open," "locking in progress," "locked," and "opening in progress." To facilitate user interaction, the system
	features a keyboard and LCD display for entering the PIN code and displaying instructions and alerts in case of suspicious activities.
        Additionally, the safety deposit box controller incorporates a servo for locking and unlocking the box and a mode for resetting the code for
	a new client or in case the user forgets the code.
The system is programmed using LabVIEW to monitor and control all components and ensure that the finite state machine detects only unique key presses. 
		Furthermore, an LED indicator can be used to signify the locking status of the safety deposit box.</p>

	<h3>ROVERBOT</h3>
	<span class="date"><span class="icon-calendar"></span>Nov 2022 - Jan 2023 </span>
	<p>
Roverbot is a mechanum wheels robotic vehicle that is designed to move in all directions, thanks to its advanced algorithms that plan the most efficient routes to reach its destination. Its unique feature is its ability to move in tight spaces with precision, thanks to its mechanum wheels. Additionally, it is equipped with a navigation system to locate its position and follow a predetermined route, as well as an obstacle detection system to avoid collisions.

Our goal is to create a robot that can move effectively through a maze using advanced autonomous navigation techniques, while being able to detect and avoid obstacles. We hope that Roverbot will be able to perform useful tasks such as surveillance, mapping, search and rescue, and delivery.

Our algorithm for this mobile robot project consists of using a matrix to represent the maze, where each cell is numbered based on its distance to the destination. The destination itself is marked with a "0", the adjacent cells are marked with a "1", the cells next to the cells marked with "1" are marked with "2" and so on, until all the cells are filled. Then, the robot is placed in a random cell and uses this matrix to plan the shortest path to reach the destination while avoiding obstacles, which are defined as cells with high values in the matrix.

	<h3>Controlling a Differential-Drive Mobile Robot Using Fuzzy Logic.</h3>
	<span class="date"><span class="icon-calendar"></span> Dec 2022 - Dec 2022</span>
	<p>
		The objective of this project is to create a fuzzy controller for a differential drive robot.
		The aim is to familiarize ourselves with fuzzy logic and to explore the capabilities of Simulink.
		The project involves modeling the kinematics of the robot in a block and linking it to a block of fuzzy logic.
		The robot has two speeds, which are both the outputs of our fuzzy controller and the inputs for the robot model. Our system is looped : 
		we initially provide the positions that the robot should reach, these positions enter a subtract block along with the estimated model measurements to provide errors that are used as inputs for the fuzzy controller. According to the rules and inference used, the controller provides the necessary speeds for the robot to navigate towards the destination. 
		The robot will reach its destination when the errors cancel each other out.

                    <span class="date"><span class="icon-calendar"></span>2/21/2024 </span>
                    <p>A comparative study was conducted using Python and Pmaze to evaluate the performance of DFS, BFS,
			    and A* search algorithms in path planning for a maze. The main objective of the project was to compare
			    the efficiency of these algorithms in terms of path cost and algorithmic complexity. No physical robot
			    was used in this study as it focused solely on the analysis of search algorithms. This study contributes
			    to the advancement of knowledge in the field of path planning by exploring different approaches for mazes
			    using Python and Pmaze.</p>

<h3>  OpenAI Stack Hackathon </h3>
<span class="date"><span class="icon-calendar"></span> February 24 - March 4, 2023</span>
<p>
 In the recent OpenAI Stack Hackathon organized by lablab.ai, I had the privilege to collaborate with a talented team from February 24th to March 4th. 
Together, we crafted 'HealthyAI,' a cross-platform application powered by OpenAI's GPT-3 model. This innovative tool provides precise medical diagnoses
	based on patient symptoms and history, offering practical home remedies as well. Grateful for the expertise of my colleagues, <stong >Mohammed Machrouh</stong> 
	and  <stong >Tanishq Kr. Kaushal</stong>, our project utilized React for frontend, Django for backend, GPT-3 for AI, and Redis as our database. Our journey 
continues as we refine the app, adding features like a health dashboard.  Explore our project at <a href="https://lnkd.in/ecwJdrpk" ></a> and the source code at
	 <a href="https://lnkd.in/eFjpYWPK" ></a> . Thanks to lablab.ai, this experience fuels my enthusiasm for future hackathons and collaborative tech ventures.

	We participated in the first 'Road Assistant Robot' challenge. The objective of this challenge was to assemble the robot from scratch and program it to overcome obstacles and reach the end of the maze. Here is an overview of the activity:

Initially, the robots were placed in their stations. Upon receiving an RFID signal (each RFID signal was assigned to a specific destination), the robot had to react and identify the type of fire present and decide which type of fire to respond to, in order to reach its destination. The robot had to navigate through static and dynamic obstacles, as well as a maze, to reach its destination.

The challenge consisted of three elimination phases, and fortunately, my team qualified for the second phase, securing the fifth position. Alhamdulillah
