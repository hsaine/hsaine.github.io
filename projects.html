						<h3>Research Internship </h3>
						<p>During my internship at the Laboratory of Systems Engineering in Versailles (LISV), which took place from June 17th to July 26st, I engaged in a research project titled "Development of a Human Movement Prediction Model for Exoskeleton Control." Over the course of these five weeks, I had the opportunity to delve into various aspects within the laboratory.

During the initial week, our focus was on comprehending articles related to EMG signals, feature extraction, and the stages of EMG signal filtering. In the subsequent week, I interpreted existing data containing recorded EMG signals from triceps and biceps muscles. This interpretation allowed us to gain insights into the signals' characteristics.

Moving on to the second week, I worked with a dataset involving "hand-to-nose movements" from 20 patients. This dataset consisted of 10 muscle EMG signals per patient. My analysis included a detailed examination of each muscle and the corresponding EMG signals. This comparison was conducted across the 20 patients.

In the third week, I had the privilege of gathering data from 10 enthusiastic volunteers who performed flexion-extension motions for both triceps and biceps muscles. The volunteers executed these motions with and without a 2 kg load, in addition to performing maximum voluntary contractions (MVC) for both muscle groups. This data collection resulted in approximately 90 sets of data.

During the final weeks of the internship, my focus shifted towards data analysis. I carefully selected complete and noise-free data recordings, discarding incomplete or unreliable entries. For each volunteer, I applied filtering techniques to the signals, followed by multiple feature extraction methods. The results of this analysis enabled the calculation of the elbow angle. This calculated angle was then compared with the angle obtained through other measurement methods to assess correlation.

Throughout this internship, I acquired knowledge about interfacing with EMG signals, ,the Vicon Camera system, and the placement of markers and how to use the 3D vicon softawre.

						<h3>Application Internship </h3>
						<p>The purpose of this internship is to develop a mobile application that solves the problem of prescription validation. The main issue is that certain drugs require validation by pharmacists before nurses can administer them to patients. This problem arises due to the large number of patients. To address this issue, we have decided to develop an application that facilitates the validation process.
                                                  By the end of this internship, our goal is to develop a prototype application and create a functional database that links doctors, nurses, and pharmacists. We will be using Wamp Server, MySQL, PHPMyAdmin, PHP, and Postman for this purpose. Additionally, we will rely on diagrams to assist in the development process.
                                                 Skills required for this internship include critical thinking, database administration, database design, proficiency in Figma (software), and the ability to work effectively in a team.</p>

						<h3>Initiation Internship</h3>
						<p>This internship provided a unique learning experience where I acquired new skills and knowledge. It served as an opportunity for me to immerse myself in the professional world and learn how to integrate effectively into a team within a company.
             					One of the highlights of this internship was the chance to gain hands-on experience in the production line of machining discs across various operands. I had the opportunity to apply my theoretical knowledge and observe the technologies used within the company, including the Metrology Service and the processes involved in operands 20 to 110, such as painting.
						Moreover, this internship proved to be a rewarding professional experience. It allowed me to not only put my knowledge into practice but also develop my analytical skills. Through analyzing and understanding the different aspects of the production line, I was able to enhance my problem-solving abilities and gain valuable insights into the industry.</p>
